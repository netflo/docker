volume is a path on the local host (could bea remote mount too)

docker volume create ...

/var/lib/docker             |   c:program\docker\windowsfilter

docker container run -dit --name web1 --mount source=host_path,target=/vol_name_2be_stored_inside_container_path   docker.io/image:tag (dit = detached + interactive)

dettached from container so persists



SECRETS

to help manage secrets given short lived
grant a service access to a secret
least priviledge model where only those hosts running the service containers get the secret.
files are decrypted and stored on the /run/secrets  
not persistent given it is a  tmpfs volume type so in memory only

docker secret create my_secret_name ./file_with_secrets
encrypted and stored in the store raft

docker service create --name serv1 --secret sec1  --replicas 3

secrets flushed from memory when  docker service rm

note on windows:  not persistent so want to store on encrypted disk / bitlocker?
