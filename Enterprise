Image scanning

CE = monthly release
EE = quaterly + certif + points above etc...

UCP
UCP is a service/containers running on your EE engine
if working being a NAT device , you may need to tick the Custom Listen+Advertise Address to add new worker nodes, if the IP used for join is not the one to use externally.
a UCP cluster is just a swarm cluster!

DTR
through  GUI can get the containers to install to get DTR (also running in the cluster)
it is possible to image scan by manual sync with tar files rather than internet connections.
to push an image, we need to allocate a tag as it is used to place in reg:

docker image tag web1 my-registry-server.blah/flo/web1:latest
docker login my-registry-server.blah   + enter user/pass
docker image push web1 my-registry-server.blah/flo/web1:latest

RBAC
subjects=people
roles=permissions
collections=resources
Grants are contracts between the above 3

with image on scan for  push , it is possible to see all known vulnerabilities in the image
