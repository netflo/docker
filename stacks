docker stack deploy   (to the swarm and needs are recorded into raft group (managers))

deploy and maintains eg. if a host dies the missing containers are moved to surviving nodes

self documenting given you define the entire stack, volumes etc...  + git for change control


example of a voting app  stackfile.yml  - 4 top levels:
version: (of the stack file)
services:
   redis:
   db:
   vote:
   result:
network:
   frontend:
   backend:
volumes:
   db-data:
   

Compose was not native!  new is stack

docker stack deploy -c stackfile.yml

docker stack ps voter
=>shows desired state and stack status

docker stack services voter

docker service scale voter_note=20 
imperative scaling not helping with stack files as it will get out of sync.
Should update stackfile  and then just run the new version of the stack file and it will
apply deltas
