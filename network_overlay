bridge0 (br0) on all hosts are connecting to a local VTEP (VxLAN Tunnel End Point) and a mesh is set up  uses UDP/4789 on the transport/underlay  

each container has a veth (virt eth) that connects to the local bridge

this allows to support  layer2 across a routed underlay
 
For SWARM mode, other ports required between hosts in case of f/w are 7946/tcp + 7946/udp  + 2377/tcp
